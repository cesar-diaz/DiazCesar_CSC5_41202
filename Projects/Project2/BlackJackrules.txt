BLACKJACK RULES
***************
Playing Blackjack is very simple and
easy to understand. The main objective 
of the game is to rech a total card
value of 21. All the cards are worth the 
number that is written of their face. 
The only exeptions to this are,
aces(worth either 1 or 11), 
jacks, queens, and kings(all worth 10).
You are initlally dealt 2 cards by the dealer
and then you may choose to either "hit" or 
"stick" which is just asking the dealer for 
another card. If your total card value is over
21 that is known as a "bust" or in other words,
you just lost the game.
